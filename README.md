# üêÄ Remy
Kitchen Management Software

Remy is the central nervous system for a kitchen and is intended to run on a home server integrating with a kitchen computer or tablet UI and a mobile client.

Remy helps with
- Tracking food amounts and expiration dates including prepped food
- Preventing food waste
- Tracking product prices, deals and availability
- Creating optimized shopping lists
- Storing product nutrition and ingredients with the scan of an existing barcode
- Eating healthier with nutrition assistance and planning
- Creating monthly "menu" foodplans
- Finding recipes and displaying them in a standard format
- Scanning and recording both handwritten, cookbook and video/described recipes
- Easily adding changes or notes to existing recipes with voice or prompt inputs
- Organizing recipes with cloud backups

This system is a very opinionated approach to kitchen management, rooted a blend of restaurant management and old school home kitchens. 
However, it tries to be as frictionless as possible, running on its own with little manual input or effort, given the system is followed.

# Using Remy
Remy is optimized for my personal kitchen, and not as a general tool. The best way to use it as your own is to fork this repository and build an image with docker.
